# Moderator Role Details
Moderators are responsible for keeping the server free of griefing or other activities which violate our agreements.

## Permissions
Moderators have access to the following moderation commands.
- `/kick`
- `/ban`
- `/pardon`
- `/whitelist`

Moderators can also do anything that [Trusted Players][] or [Noobs][] can do.

## Responsibilities
When a player breaks a rule (e.g. is griefing), a moderator should perform the following the following steps in order. (With a few exceptions.)

1. Inform the player that they are breaking a rule and of which rule(s) they are breaking.
2. If they continue to break the rule, use `/kick`.
3. If they still persist in breaking the rule, use `/ban`. (Players can contact a moderator is they feel their ban should be lifted.)
4. After some time has passed, tell the player that you will use `/pardon` if they agree not to continue breaking the rule.

Exceptions:
- When a player is breaking a rule in a manner that is urgent or time sensitive, a moderator may use `/kick` or may PvP them before informing the player that they are breaking a rule/agreement.
- When a player is attacking you, use PvP to defend yourself if necessary.

Moderators are also obligated to do everything that [Trusted Players][] and [Noobs][] are obligated to do.

## Rules
- Don't Kick or Ban anyone who isn't griefing.
- Don't Ban anyone without warning.
- Don't Kick or Ban any founders or other moderators.
- Follow all rules that [Trusted Players][] and [Noobs][] follow.
